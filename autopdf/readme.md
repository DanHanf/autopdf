**welcome to auto_pdf_serv_bot**

*~a dynamically generated and sorted list of pdfs since 2014~*

you don't have to do all that stuff anymore!
* if you're trying to upload a pdf for an org that doesn't exist you gotta create it
	* otherwise just go ahead and click on the org you want
* upload any ol' pdf your little heart desires


~~this is what you gotta do~~
* find the pdf you want 
* drive your little internet car to autopdf/public/pdfs 
* if a directory for who the pdf belongs to does not exist, go ahead and create it
* drop that pdf right into the place you want it
* if you are consistently experiencing tumultuous sleep, try riding a bike for several miles and then drinking uncafinated teas or popping a melatonin before laying in bed.
	* remember, the light from a computer screen can get trapped inside your head and hella bang on your eyelids all night if you fall asleep with the computer on. 
	* try reading a book instead
	* *don't worry!* the book you read can be about computers. as long as it's actually a book, your eyelids won't get hella banged on throughout the night
	

*if you gotta start this app just type in forever start app.js and there you go*
