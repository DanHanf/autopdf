	* if you can not afford decent meat, i understand. i hope that one day you can
	* the mustard with the seeds in it should be used for the sandwich the reach its highest potential
		* even if you can not afford decent meat, using this kind of mustard will improve your sandwich experience greatly

~~this is what you gotta do~~
~~* find the pdf you want 
* drive your little internet car to autopdf/public/pdfs 
* if a directory for who the pdf belongs to does not exist, go ahead and create it
* drop that pdf right into the place you want it
* if you are consistently experiencing tumultuous sleep, try riding a bike for several miles and then drinking uncafinated teas or popping a melatonin before laying in bed.
	* remember, the light from a computer screen can get trapped inside your head and hella bang on your eyelids all night if you fall asleep with the computer on. 
	* try reading a book instead
	* *don't worry!* the book you read can be about computers. as long as it's actually a book, your eyelids won't get hella banged on throughout the night~~
